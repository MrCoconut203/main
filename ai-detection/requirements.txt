# Allow a compatible ultralytics version to be selected from PyPI
ultralytics>=8.0.0,<9.0

# NOTE: ultralytics depends on PyTorch. Installing torch can be platform-specific.
# For a CPU-only build we pin the CPU wheel. If you have CUDA, replace this with a
# matching CUDA wheel from https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
# The Dockerfile installs this wheel before installing the rest of requirements.
# Do NOT add torch here; it's installed explicitly in the Dockerfile to ensure
# pip pulls the correct prebuilt wheel instead of trying to build from source.
